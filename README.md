# CS255--System-Analysis-and-Design

For this project our client was DriverPass

This client needed a system that would allow them to help users get ready for, and pass their driver's test at the DMV.

I think I did pretty well on my diagrams and ensuring that all information was included that the client requested for the system to run effectively.

One thing I would improve is more detail in my class diagram. I was unsure how much detail to include.

I used the transcripted conversation with the DriverPass owner and IT admin to ensure that all aspects of their vision were included in the finished design

My approach is to start with a list of things that need to be included, arrange the list in order of how it should flow, and implement it in that order so the code flows well and is easy to understand.
